1. Write a simple rust api that needs persistent storage & produces prometheus metrics.

2. Containerize and deploy your Rust API to a Kubernetes cluster.

-You can use KIND or Minikube. It's possible there is a free or cheap cloud option out there too.
-Bonus points for using Pulumi but it may be easier/valuable to begin with vanilla yaml definitions. 

3. Monitor the logs and metrics of your api.

-You can deploy services as DaemonSets for log collection and other things
-Grafana Alloy may be used to scrape metrics
-Free Grafana Cloud should work for the visualizer/metrics data stores
-Bonus points for running your own prometheus and loki instances instead of using grafana cloud, but it's kind of a lot
-Bonus points for having any kind of alerting off of metrics. PagerDuty or Grafana IRM may have free options. This is the most optional part
